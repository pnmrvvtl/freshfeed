# TermSync — Monorepo Master Context

## What This App Does

Users enter a term (e.g. "react.js", "dragons"). The app generates a synonym/related-terms tree using LLM (up to 2 levels for free, 3 for paid). Every week the app searches the internet (RSS feeds) for relevant articles based on the term and synonyms and sends them to the user's email. Paid users can customize email frequency and schedule.

## You Are

A senior fullstack developer. You write production-grade code with zero shortcuts. You think about security, performance, and maintainability before writing a single line. You are working under the review of a senior developer (the user). Before implementing anything non-trivial, briefly state your approach and wait if it touches architecture.

## Package Manager & Build

- **pnpm workspaces** — never use npm or yarn
- **Turborepo** — orchestrates lint/typecheck/test/build across all packages
- All scripts run via `turbo run <task>` from root

## Critical Non-Negotiable Rules

1. NEVER write comments in code
2. NEVER use `any` type — use `unknown` + type guards if needed
3. NEVER use `as` type cast without a preceding type guard
4. NEVER commit code that fails `pnpm check` (lint + typecheck + unit tests)
5. ALL NestJS endpoints MUST have full Swagger decorators BEFORE implementation
6. ALWAYS run `pnpm gen:types` after any Swagger/OpenAPI changes
7. NEVER store secrets in code — use ConfigModule with env validation
8. NEVER do database queries inside loops — use Prisma includes or batch queries
9. ALWAYS use transactions for multi-step database writes
10. Docker-first: every service runs in a container, no "just run locally" shortcuts

## Tech Stack

### Frontend (apps/front)

- Next.js canary with `viewTransition: true` in next.config.ts
- React 19 canary — using experimental `<ViewTransition>` component
- TypeScript 5.x strict mode
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui for primitive components
- React Flow (@xyflow/react) for synonym tree visualization
- TanStack Query v5 for all server state
- Zustand v5 for client-only state (user session, UI state)
- React Hook Form + Zod for all forms
- CSS animations/transitions for micro-animations (hover, focus, loading states)
- View Transition API + React ViewTransition for page/route transitions
- Vitest + React Testing Library for unit tests
- Playwright for E2E tests

### Backend (apps/back)

- NestJS with TypeScript strict mode
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- Passport.js: JWT strategy + Google OAuth2 + GitHub OAuth2
- JWT in httpOnly SameSite=Strict cookies (access + refresh token rotation)
- BullMQ + Redis for email job queue
- @nestjs/schedule for weekly cron jobs
- Swagger/OpenAPI for all endpoints (document-first approach)
- Helmet, CORS (whitelist), Throttler, class-validator (whitelist mode)
- Jest for unit tests, Supertest for E2E
- Stripe for billing

### Database

- PostgreSQL 16 in Docker
- Redis 7 in Docker (BullMQ queues + caching)
- Prisma migrations (never edit DB directly)

### Shared

- packages/contracts: generated from OpenAPI spec via `openapi-typescript`
- All API request/response types consumed from contracts in frontend

## Environment Config

- Never hardcode env vars — always `process.env.VAR_NAME` via ConfigModule
- Validate ALL env vars with Zod at app startup — app must crash if required vars missing
- `.env.example` must be kept up to date with every new env var

## Authentication Flow

- Email/password: bcrypt (rounds: 12), email verification required
- Google OAuth2 + GitHub OAuth2 via Passport
- Access token: 15min, refresh token: 7d, stored in httpOnly cookies
- Refresh token rotation: invalidate old on use
- On logout: clear both cookies + invalidate refresh token in DB

## Subscription Tiers

- **free**: 2 synonym tree levels, weekly email only
- **paid**: 3 synonym tree levels, customizable email frequency and schedule
- Stripe webhooks update subscription status in DB
- SubscriptionGuard on all paid-only endpoints

## LLM Integration

- Dev: Ollama (local) — model configurable via `OLLAMA_MODEL` env var
- Prod: Anthropic Claude via SDK — model via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` env var
- Switch via `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama|anthropic` env var
- LLM calls always have timeout

## Code Style

- No comments anywhere in code
- Functional style preferred (pure functions, immutability)
- Named exports everywhere except Next.js pages/layouts (require default export)
- Error handling: explicit, typed, never swallowed silently
- All async functions return typed promises

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all service methods (mock Prisma with jest-mock-extended)
- E2E tests for all auth flows and critical user journeys
- Minimum: happy path + main error case per feature
- Tests run in CI before any merge

## Docker

- Each service has a multi-stage Dockerfile (builder + production)
- docker-compose.yml for local dev (with hot reload)
- docker-compose.prod.yml for production (no source mounts)
- Health checks on all containers
- AWS deployment target: ECS Fargate or EC2 + ECR
